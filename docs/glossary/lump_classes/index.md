## [BasicLumpClass](basic_lump_classes.md)

## [LumpClass](lump_classes.md)

Repeated structures stored in the same lump.


## [SpecialLumpClass](special_lump_classes.md)

Complex lump structure, more advanced than a regular list.


## [GameLump](game_lump.md)

Used in the [Source Engine](../../engines/source.md), functions as a `.bsp` within a `.bsp`
