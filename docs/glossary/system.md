# System

A system is a collection of [Lumps](lump.md) that are used for a common purpose.
The term "System" has been coined in these docs to help explain lumps in an abstract context.
Engines won't nessecarily "think" of the data in the same way.
It's just one way of understanding how & why different [Lumps](lump.md) work together.
