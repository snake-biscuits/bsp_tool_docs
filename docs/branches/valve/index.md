# Valve Software

Developers of the GoldSrc Engine, building on idTech 2.
This variant powered Half-Life & CS:1.6.

Later, they would build the Source Engine for Half-Life 2


## Trivia
A `.bsp` with invalid `FILE_MAGIC` can throw the error: "Not an IBSP file"
However, Valve's `FILE_MAGIC` is `VBSP`
They kept the IdTech 2 error message, dating back to Quake 2!
