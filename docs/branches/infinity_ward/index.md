# Infinity Ward

Original developers on the Call of Duty series
Branching off from 2015 Inc.
Where they worked on [Medal of Honor: Allied Assault](../ritual/mohaa/index.md)
The MoH series being a similar WWII spectacle shooter franchise
A series produced by Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks Interactive
Capitalising on the success of Saving Private Ryan

Infinity Ward were out to build a MoH Killer[^mk]
But more than that, they wanted to build a Modern Military Shooter
A genre which exploded in popularity after the release of CoD 4: Modern Warfare
However, the genre predates Modern Warfare[^rcvk]


## Respawn Entertainment Split
In 2011, an internal dispute led to a multi-million dollar lawsuit
Infinity Ward split in half, leading to the founding of Respawn Entertainment
Call of Duty being such a major brand at the time, this got a lot of coverage
