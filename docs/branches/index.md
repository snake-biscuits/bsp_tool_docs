# Format Variants

Each [BranchScript](../concepts/branch_scripts.md) describes a variant of the `.bsp` format.
Almost all branches can trace their lineage back to [Quake](id_software/quake.md).

Except for [Genesis3D](wild_tangent/genesis3d.md).
Which seems to have taken many similar approaches at around the same time.
Id Software was certainly influential, but they're hardly pioneers.



## Inheritance

[BranchScripts](../concepts/branch_scripts.md) inherit from one another where [LumpClasses](../concepts/lump_classes/index.md) can be reusued.
This occurs in roughly chronogical order, where possible / sensible.

One notable example of where this rule is broken is `troika.vampire`.
Since **Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines** released before **Half-Life 2**, but was still built on the Source Engine.
